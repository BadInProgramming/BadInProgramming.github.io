        This is a website made for a science
        report. The website is a choice game
        where the questions are about Philippine
        Endemic animals and ways of caring and protecting
        animals. Note that the captcha is an ụ̵͉̓n̸̳̄ͅẽ̴̳̎͜ť̴̞̘͊̈͜h̸͙̑͛i̵̦̱̇͌̇c̶̗̯͗a̸̡̟̽l̴̤̯̓͜ captcha.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website was made in 6 days worked for like 6 days straight and maybe rested on the seventh day.
        There will be a lot glitches and I don't care at all!   
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I'm running out of thing to say ...
    </p>
    <p> Now I remebered The pain.In the time trying to make the captcha work it was painful like some thing don't work
        and other worked with no sence, and the most painful thing while making the captcha was the verify I try to do some for loops and thing to 
        make the code better but failed with thing that don't know what was happending but worked out in end.
